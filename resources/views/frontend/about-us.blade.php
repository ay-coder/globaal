       <p><strong>About A G E</strong></p>
<p>Aesthetics Global Evolution, or A G E, is simply your home base for <em>all</em> things aesthetic.</p>
<p>A G E is an aesthetic mobile application focused on giving all participants of this massive aesthetic global community equal opportunity for success. As the aesthetic industry multiplies exponentially and aesthetic practices and medical spas pop up like coffee shops, A G E wants to make sure there is one reliable source for all those involved: patients, providers, and companies. &nbsp;A G E brings together shared empowerment for every corner of this triangle.</p>
<p>Our app is motivated to work for you, to help maximize your experience in aesthetics from start to-hopefully never- finish. Our app is time-efficient, simple, interactive, and always advancing to do its very best to help you connect and navigate through the industry. A few app features of how A G E is dedicated to work for you:</p>
